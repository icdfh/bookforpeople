The project consists of two parts:
Backend(SpringBoot) and Frontend(React), MySQL database, Docker and many other libraries are also used.
How to start a project Download these two folders, then open Backend(demo) in Spring, and open the second one in VsCode or something else.

On Spring, install all your dependencies that you need
On React, ur first step is NPM INSTALL, and check all dependencies like react-router-dom and axios.
